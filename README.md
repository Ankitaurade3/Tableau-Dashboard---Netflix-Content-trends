- tableau/            : Tableau workbook(s) and packaged data sources
- sql/                : Reusable SQL queries
- images/             : Charts and dashboard screenshots
- README.md           : This file

## How to use
1. Open the Tableau workbook(s) in the `tableau/` folder to view the dashboards.
2. Use the `notebooks/` folder for reproducible data cleaning and EDA in Python.
3. Re-run the SQL queries in the `sql/` folder against your dataset to reproduce trend tables.

## Notes
